            <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

            <p>
              1. Ownership of explorations is temporary and eventually reverts to the Oppia community. The
              idea is to make it easy for the explorations on this site to improve continuously.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. Please exercise judgement before publishing an exploration. Every exploration on this site
              should have significant educational value, and should not contain advertising, spam, vandalism
              or abuse.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. Creating multiple usernames, using explorations to trick users, or circumventing site
              features that are meant to encourage the improvement of explorations are examples of
              antisocial behavior that may result in account suspension.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. For contentious topics and clarifications on guidelines, please use the Oppia discussion
              forum.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. The governance model for Oppia comprises site admins and moderators. Site admins manage
              and have overall responsibility for the site; they are the final arbitrators on any dispute.
              Moderators suggest and review major edits for explorations, and enforce the behavioral norms
              described within these community guidelines.
            </p>


            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="exploration-publishing-criteria"></a>
            <h2>Exploration Publishing Criteria</h2>
            <p>
              In order to ensure that Oppia is filled with high-quality explorations that do a good job of
              helping people learn something new, there are some minimal criteria for publishing an exploration
              and, later, for moving it to the "featured" stage.
            </p>

            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-criteria"></a>
            <h3>Publication criteria</h3>
            <p>
              The following criteria for publishing an exploration are meant to ensure that published
              explorations can be playtested meaningfully, and that it is possible to continue
              developing and refining these explorations to move towards being featured. These criteria
              are intended to be objective and precise, so that it is easy for anyone to determine whether
              a particular exploration fits the criteria.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>It teaches something.</strong> The exploration should present information
              that is new to the target audience, and not just test knowledge that its target
              audience is already assumed to have.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>It teaches more than a single factoid.</strong> The information presented
              should be either "deep" - an involved and tricky concept that has nuances and depth
              to it, or "broad" - a collection of related interesting facts that the learner can
              understand and remember better after playing through the exploration.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>It provides informative feedback.</strong> The feedback that it provides to
              the players should be more than just "Correct" or "Incorrect"; it should provide (or
              guide players toward) the reasoning about why something is right or wrong, and how
              to correct it if necessary. An exploration should be more than just a quiz!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>It doesn't duplicate an existing published exploration</strong>. It's fine
              to teach the same thing using a significantly different way of teaching, but if a
              new exploration teaches the exact same things as an existing one, in the same way,
              then the effort would be better spent submitting feedback to, and improving, the
              existing one.
            </p>

            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="featured-criteria"></a>
            <h3>"Featured" criteria</h3>
            <p>
              The criteria for featuring an exploration are meant to ensure that featured
              explorations are educational, interesting to our learners, and make appropriate
              use of the interactive, discovery-based learning style that the Oppia tool enables.
              The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/wiki/DesignTips">Design Tips</a> wiki
              page has some constructive advice on how to create explorations that fit these criteria,
              and especially on how to design useful, formative feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Understanding, not memorization.</strong> Does the exploration attempt to
              teach some interesting concept, or does it merely provide facts for the student to
              memorize?
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Learning, not assessment.</strong> Does the exploration present new concepts
              to the learners, or does it simply quiz them on some set of topics? (Even if a quiz
              later gives out the right answers, this does not necessarily help a learner master
              the new concepts effectively.)
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Learn by doing.</strong> How is the new information presented to the learner?
              Does he have a chance to reason about the concepts himself, try out using them, and
              receive feedback on what he did?
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Formative feedback.</strong> Does the feedback that you provide to the learner
              give him new useful insights into the problem? Does it find a good middle ground between
              simply telling the user he's wrong (or right), and giving the entire answer away? Do the
              feedback rules cover a wide range of possible answers and misconceptions? Is there a
              catch-all default rule that nevertheless tries to guide the learner toward a good
              solution?
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Complete and polished.</strong> Is the exploration free of typos, factual errors
              and bugs? Is the text well-written and easy to read? Does the exploration deliver all
              the content it has promised to the learner, either within the exploration or as stated
              in the learning objective?
            </p>


            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-policies"></a>
            <h2>Publication policies</h2>
            <p>
              The following policies help Oppia moderators enforce the criteria for publishing and
              featuring explorations. All explorations hosted on {{SITE_NAME}} should ultimately be
              improved to the point where they satisfy these criteria.
            </p>

            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publishing-an-exploration"></a>
            <h3>Publishing an exploration</h3>
            <p>
              Any owner of a private exploration can make the decision to publish an exploration at
              any time. However, if the published exploration does not fit the
              <a href="#exploration-publishing-criteria">publication criteria</a>, the site moderators
              may unpublish or delete it, at their discretion. (The norm is to unpublish; deletion is
              only likely to happen in egregious cases, such as outright spam.)
            </p>

            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="editing-rights"></a>
            <h3>Editing rights</h3>
            <p>
              Explorations are meant to be polished and developed until they can be featured. An
              exploration that has not been edited for a prolonged period may be considered "orphaned",
              and ownership of it may revert to the community at large (at moderator discretion), so
              that {{SITE_NAME}} community members can continue to improve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that when you embed a particular version of your exploration in your site, this
              embedded version will not change unless the original exploration on {{SITE_NAME}} is
              unpublished or deleted. In particular, even if you or other community members make
              further additions or changes to the exploration on {{SITE_NAME}}, the version embedded
              on your website will remain the same.
            </p>

            <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="releasing-an-exploration"></a>
            <h3>Releasing an exploration</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, the process of releasing an exploration is moderator-driven, though we hope
              to make it more community-driven in the future. When an owner of the exploration - or
              anybody else involved in the process - thinks the exploration is ready to be featured,
              they can post to the
              <a href="{{MODERATOR_REQUEST_FORUM_URL}}" target="_blank">Moderator Requests forum</a>
              with a request for moderator review. A moderator will play through the exploration,
              look at its structure, and decide whether it fits the Featured
              <a href="#publication-criteria">criteria</a>. If it does, then the
              exploration will be marked as featured. If it does not, the moderator will make a series
              of specific suggestions on how to make the exploration conform to the criteria, and work
              with the creator(s) in that forum thread to get it polished and ready to be featured.
            </p>
